# ReportGenerator

This project was created to generate reports. From a file containing all the data that has been invoiced, the code takes the data piece by piece to 
create a report for the different Parners and transfer this to a unique folder.

I have used request in the code as it is much quicker than getting a standard response from Google.

This code was written in Google Sheets.
